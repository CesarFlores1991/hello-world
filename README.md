Hello, my name is Cesar Flores-Ortiz. I go by "say-zar" or "caesar" like the salad. i have an amazing wife and 4 wonderful children that are the world to me. I chose to go back and finish school to find a career rather than a job. As a child of immigrants, i owe it to my parents to get a degree and pursue my passion for IT.
